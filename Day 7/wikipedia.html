                <h2>Ancient Nepal</h2>
                <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
                    Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains
                    in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological
                    evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[33]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of
                    permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other
                    sites in what is now Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley
                    Civilisation,[35][34] the first urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of
                    palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of
                    Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed
                    to be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people
                    whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in</p>
